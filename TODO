Use UTF-8 in *ALL* XML files!

Use XMLUni::.... constants instead of strings in setFeature and setProperty.

All logging must be done from the readBytes call.

The parser should be reimplemented using the DefaultHandler interface,
instead of the ContentHandler and ErrorHandler interfaces.

Thwe parse call shall be rewritten to make it a one call parse
(not using parseFirst/parseNext), this should make it use less memory.

Look at how the file parser is implemented, if possible inherit from MemBufFile whatnot,
to make it use constant buffer size.

Enable/disable the validation as data nodes are encountered.

Make a data node wrapper node and enable/disable validation on it, if the above doesn't work.





ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:

Read from stream, and parse header.

When done parsing header, stop parsing, and create logfile.

Dump entire stream to disk.

Read xml from file, and parse it in a second pass.
